            <h1>THE STORY OF DIOR</h1>
            <p>
                trying to convince Dior to embrace his future. was doubtless the question in the mind of the man who did
                not yet realise the magnitude of what he was<br>
                to bring to haute couture, women and France's position abroad. However, while walking up the Rue du
                Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Christian Dior hit his<br>
                foot on an object on the ground and almost tripped, as though it was the object itself that wished to
                attract his attention. He turned, drew nearer,<br>
                realised that he was right in front of the British Embassy and this made him think of his childhood in
                Granville, Normandy, opposite the British Isles,<br>
                and his friend Georges Vigouroux. He also remembered the dilemma that he was to face the following day
                with Marcel Boussac. Christian Dior leaned<br>
                over and picked up the object that had nearly made him fall over:

                    <p>
                        Overlooking the sea, its elegant façade facing into the winds, on a clear day <br>
                        you can see the islands of Chausey and even Jersey. <br>
                        It is an Anglo-Norman villa, like many built in the late 19th century. <br>
                        Constructed by a Mr Beust, a ship owner by trade, it owed its name, Les Rhumbs, <br>
                        to the 32 divisions of the wind rose meticulously reproduced in mosaics on the <br>
                        ground at the entrance. Solidly gripping the rock, positioned within <br>
                        a hectare of clifftop garden, it faced the elements and its destiny. <br>
                        The Granville villa was the house where the Dior family <br>
                        lived at the turn of the last century.

                    <p>
                        Christian Dior's closest friends included few couturiers, but a great many artists.<br>
                        His parents refused to let him attend a fine arts school,<br>
                        telling him that it would not help him to find a real job.<br>
                        Despite his respect for them, he nonetheless did what he wanted...<br>
                        Initially, he reassured Madeleine and Maurice Dior by enrolling<br>
                        at the Institute of Political Science on Rue Saint-Guillaume.<br>
                        Above all, the school allowed him to enjoy the fantastic <br>
                        nightlife that Paris had to offer. His father also agreed to his learning<br>
                        'musical composition' in order to perfect the piano lessons.

                        can tie you to them forever. As soon as he saw it, he had to have it<br>
                        Passing in front of 30 Avenue Montaigne, Christian Dior knew that this<br>
                        little townhouse would be home to his couture label.<br>
                        Things never work out that easily, of course. Although...

                        This is the story of a quip, which thanks to a magical moment, forged a legend. <br>
                        On 12 February 1947 at 10.30 a.m. Christian Dior, aged 42, <br>
                        presented his first collection at 30 Avenue Montaigne<br>
                        which was strewn with flowers by Lachaume. <br>
                        The Editor-in-Chief of, Carmel Snow, strongly believed in the couturier's <br>
                        talent, which she had already noted in 1937 with the model that he designed for <br>
                        Robert Piguet. At the end of the fashion show, having seen those <br>
                        unique silhouettes, those lengths, those volumes, <br>
                        those tiny waists and devilishly sexy busts, she exclaimed,

                        He who believed in his lucky star and loved America could not fail <br>
                        to rub shoulders with the "stars" of the cinema. Very early on, he crossed <br>
                        the paths of actresses who did not know what they were to become... <br>
                        For the 18th birthday of his god-daughter, the daughter of Jacques <br>
                        Bonjean, the future couturier designed a black velvet dress <br>
                        with a broad, mid-length skirt with round pleats, fastened with a black patent-leather belt.
